                                <p>Each two minute match was between two
                                    alliances of three robots each. The playing 
                                    field was set up as a sort of racetrack, 
                                    where robot motion could only go in one 
                                    direction between 4 zones on the field. 4 
                                    large inflated 'trackballs' were placed on 
                                    racks that went across the middle of the
                                    field. Points were awarded for driving laps 
                                    around the track. Even more points were 
                                    awarded for driving laps around the track 
                                    with the trackball in possession, and more 
                                    points than that were awarded for 'hurdling'
                                    the ball over the rack that went over the 
                                    field. At the end of the match, points were 
                                    awarded for having your team's trackballs on
                                    the racks.</p>
