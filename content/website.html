                    <p>team766.com runs off of a custom CMS written in 
                        PHP 5.5 by Patrick Tam. The CMS uses an XML file to 
                        load HTML files which store each page, negating the need for a database.</p>
                    <p>Twitter's Bootstrap template was used to ensure that 
                        this site scales for mobile use.</p>
                    <p>The site is hosted on a Digial Ocean VPS running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and
                        the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.</p>

                            2013 to the winter of 2014. Special thanks to Nicky Ivy
