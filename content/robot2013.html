                                    <li>Frisbee Shooter - 1 Banebot RS-550 
                                        motor is connected to a Vex 3:1 
                                        Planetary Gearbox, which powers an 
                                        Andymark Pneumatic wheel. Frisbees 
                                        are pushed into the wheel by 2 Bimba
                                        pneumatic pistons. The angle and speed 
                                        of the shooter is fixed, and it is 
                                        angled to shoot at the top goal from 
                                        the corner of the pyramid.</li>
                                    <li>Hopper - The hopper can store a total 
                                        of 4 Frisbees. 2 Frisbees are stored 
                                        in the shooter, and 2 more are stacked
                                        in the top of the hopper. Once the 2 
                                        Frisbees stored in the shooter are 
                                        fired, a pneumatic piston retracts, 
                                        and allows 2 more Frisbees to fall 
                                        into the shooter</li>
                                    <li>Climber - Our climber can climb the 
                                        1st level. 2 Large Pneumatic pistons 
                                        are attached to bars on the side of
                                        the robot. 2 large and slightly modified
                                        meat hooks are attached to the pistons, 
                                        and pull up the robot at the end of the 
                                        game.</li>

                                        The one closer to the loaded Frisbees is 
                                        on a 3:1 reduction, and the one farther is 
                                        a 1:1 direct drive, both motors connected 
                                        to soft blue BaneBots wheels. Frisbees are

                                        the game animation.</a></p>
                                <p>This year's field is open, with only a 
                                    truss crossing over the middle, 10 point 
                                    goals at each end of the field, 1 point 
                                    goals in each corner, and 3 zones on the 
                                    field. The game pieces are large 28 inch 
                                    diameter inflated balls.</p>
                                <p>The match begins with a 10 second autonomous 
                                    mode period, where the robots can shoot 
                                    balls autonomously into goals. Each side of 
                                    the goal is lit up as 'hot' for 5 of the 10
                                    seconds, gaining extra points if a shot goes 
                                    in while the goal is 'hot.'</p>
                                <p>During the 2 minute teleop period, each 
                                    team must score any missed autonomous 
                                    balls into either the 1 or 10 point
                                    goals before a 'cycle' can start. A 
                                    'cycle' begins when a robot in the
                                    first zone of the field takes the
                                    ball. An 'assist' is defined as one
                                    alliance member possessing the ball
                                    in one zone of the field. 10 points 
                                    may be gained by launching the ball 
                                    over the truss, and another 10 may be
                                    gained by having another team catch 
                                    the ball, though the ball may also be
                                    passed to a human player or simply left
                                    to bounce around the field. 10 points 
                                    are awarded if the ball is shot into
                                    the main goal, and 1 point is awarded 
                                    if it is dropped into the 1 point goal.
                                    Upon score in either goal, assist points
                                    of 10 points each are awarded.</p>
