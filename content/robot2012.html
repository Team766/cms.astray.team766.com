                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_Rumble">

                                        the game animation.</a></p>
                                <p>Each two minute match (preceded by a 15 
                                    second autonomous period) was between
                                    two alliances of three robots each. 
                                    The game pieces were small 8 inch 
                                    diameter foam basketballs. The field
                                    had basketball hoop targets at each
                                    end (in a pattern of 1 on top, 3 points,
                                    2 in the middle level, 2 points, and one
                                    on the bottom, 1 point.) In the middle of
                                    the field there were 3 balancing ramps; at
                                    the end of the match points would be awarded
                                    for balancing on one of the team ramps, or 
                                    'coopertition' points would be awarded for
                                    balancing on the center one with a member 
                                    of the other alliance. Coopertition points
                                    do not add to the match points but do 
                                    factor into a team's ranking in the standings.</p>

                                <hr class="divider">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The first iteration's drivetrain was
                                        a unique idea to try to conquer the 
                                        bump in the center of the field. What
                                        resulted was a robot which went over 
                                        the bump extremely smoothly, but could
                                        not turn at all. Once the robot was 
                                        finished, it so turned out that the 
                                        robot was literally perfectly balanced,
                                        which we attempted at during design but
                                        did not expect for it to actually happen. 
                                        Before we adjusted things, if the 
                                        wheels were down, we could run the 
                                        wheels of the robot at full speed 
                                        and it would not move at all. Even 
                                        when we adjusted the balance of the
                                        robot, the center of gravity was still
                                        largely over the unpowered wheels, so 
                                        we still could barely turn. With the
                                        wheels raised, the powered wheels were
                                        too far apart to make turning practical.</li>
                                    <li>During an outreach event,
                                        <a href="http://team766.com/sites/default/files/2012-05-19%252018.13.58_0.jpg" type="image/jpeg; length=719530">
                                            we managed to pop a pneumatic tube,
                                        </a>&nbsp;creating an alarmingly loud noise.
                                        The cause was found to be that the tube was 
                                        weakened by the compressor, which had 
                                        been running often during the preceding 
                                        time, and had become quite warm. Later 
                                        robots had more brass pneumatic connectors 
                                        between the compressor and the tube.</li>
                                    <li>The rebuild of the robot was the first
                                        time the team had completely rebuilt a 
                                        robot over the summer, as the 2006 summer 
                                        modifications still retained the base 
                                        and drivetrain of the previous iterations.</li>
                                    <li>The second iteration was the first Team 766 
                                        robot to use C++ code.</li>
