                                <p>For a more detailed explanation, see 
                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_Motion">
                                        the Wikipedia article</a> and

                                        the game animation.</a></p>

                                <p>Each two minute match (preceded by a 15 second 
                                    autonomous period) was between two alliances 
                                    of three robots each. The game pieces were 3 
                                    different types of tubes, red triangles, 
                                    white circles, and blue squares, representing 
                                    each piece of the FIRST logo. Each end of the 
                                    field has a 3 x 6 set of pegs for holding tubes
                                    on. Points were awarded for hanging tubes in
                                    the shape of a FIRST logo on the pegs, with more 
                                    points awarded the higher up the logo was made.
                                    During autonomous mode, yellow 'Ubertubes' 
                                    could be put up (without human control to do so)
                                    which would double the value of tubes placed
                                    on that same peg during the match. In the last 
                                    15 seconds of the match, minibots could be 
                                    deployed up one of 4 poles on the playing field,
                                    with each place in the race being awarded points,
                                    with 1st place receiving 40 points, 2nd with 30,
                                    and so on.</p>

                                        design made out of red and yellow
                                        electrical tape done on the claw, 
                                        which has since been turned into a 
                                        hole to reduce weight on the claw,
                                        which proved somewhat unwieldy.</li>
                                    <li>One of the team's pet tennis balls, Wilson, 
                                        usually resides on top of the L-bracket used to
                                        hold the surgical tubing which provides 
                                        stability for the claw. (where there is
                                        duct tape in the above picture) Otherwise,
                                        he can be found with his girlfriend, Penny.</li>
